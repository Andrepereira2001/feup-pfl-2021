## Function

| Function             | fibRec |
| ---                  | ---    |
| __Usage Cases__          | We tested for each integer number till x and it does not work for negative numbers.        |
| __Function Description__ | The function adopts a __recursive strategy__ because every time it needs sum the previous two numbers of the sequence it calls the same function recursively with those two parameters. We just defined the first two elements of the sequence (0 and 1) and then it calculates the _nth_ one.       |
